# Anime Classifier: Multinomial NaÃ¯ve Bayes

#### Work in Progress

## Goal
Classify animes using their synopses into genres.

| Synopsis | Classification
| --- | --- |
| Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called titans[...] | [Action, Military, Mystery, Super Power, Drama, Fantasy, Shounen]

## What is the Naive Bayes algorithm?
The algorithm we are going to use is the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. It is a simple probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem describes a conditional probability: the probability of a event given another event.

The general idea, applied to our problem, is that we are going to compute the "probability" of an anime being of or not being of a particular genre given its synopsis, which means given each word in its synopsis. The highest "probability" between the two will be our verdict.
The algorithm learns from previously classified animes to classify new ones.

## What is our accuracy goal?
We would like to have an accuracy per genre of at least 80%. It means that, for a given genre, at least 80% of animes were assigned an accurate presence or absence value for this genre.

## Steps
* Fetch anime data using an API
* Parse this data into class instances to facilitate processing
* Create a DataFrame using our data, adding, for each word of the vocabulary, its number of occurrences in each synopsis
* Implement the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm -> calculate constants + classify
* Compute the accuracy in details
* Analyze, Visualize and interpret these accuracies
* Analyze, Visualize and interpret correlations
